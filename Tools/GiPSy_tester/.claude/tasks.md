# Tasks

## Done
- [x] Research USB VID/PID, bootloader protocol, MAVLink per-instance
      health limitations, default stream rates
- [x] Scaffold `Tools/GiPSy_tester/` package (`port_scan.py`,
      `bootloader.py`, `health.py`, `gui.py`, `run.py`)
- [x] Write README, opt-in Windows COM-port cleanup script
- [x] `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `tasks.md`, `lessons.md`

## Done (cont.)
- [x] Test against a real GiPSy-mini board in both bootloader mode
      and app mode — sync probe correctly detects bootloader mode,
      no false positives against live MAVLink. Found: first connect
      after flashing needs a full power cycle, not just a
      bootloader->app jump — see lessons.md. Updated the
      bootloader-detected status message accordingly.

## Next
- [ ] Confirm actual baud rate ArduPilot uses on USB CDC (currently
      assumes 57600 for the mavutil connection — USB CDC ignores the
      requested baud in practice, but pymavlink's serial connection
      path still wants a value; verify no issues in practice)
- [ ] Decide if PatrionicPH7X/GiPSy (full-size) need any per-board
      differences (assumption: no, protocol is board-agnostic)
- [ ] Optional: package as a single .exe (PyInstaller) for handing
      off to someone without a Python environment
